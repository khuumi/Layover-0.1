A simple app to help you plan short trips built using the FourSquare API. To simplify running local instances of this app we removed the connectivity with a database and replaced it with browser LocalStorage to store the users intineraries. 

To run it just download as zip, open index.html, and start planning. Works best on latest version of Chrome. 

Built for User Interface Design Fall 2013 by James Hong, Daniel Maxson (Khuumi) , Siddharth Boobna, and Martin Li.
